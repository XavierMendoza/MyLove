        <p>
I will love you forever, and always
my love for you will transcend even my last days
From the moment I fell for you I have always knew
there’s nothing our love couldn’t get us through

I am forever grateful to have you in my life
and I dream every night of the day I get to call you, my wife
I feel so honored and blessed to have your love
I thank God and pray to Him above

I know how lucky I am to have a woman like you
My love for you will always remain true
My thoughts of you never leave my mind
When I’m with you all I wish is that we have more time

Every moment I share with you is filled with joy
I feel happy again and smile just like when I was a boy
I love you baby and I can’t thank you enough
With you I feel safe, I don’t always have to be tough

My only goal is to make you happy and give you the life you deserve
I promise I’ll be the best husband, always there to serve
You are my life, my world, my reason to live
To make you smile, there’s nothing I wouldn’t give

You have my soul and you have my heart
The love we share is unbeatable, nothing will tear it apart
Even without a ring, I’ll always see you as my wife
To protect you, I’d give up my life

Thank you for the love you’ve given me
I am forever grateful and only wish to see you happy
You are my sunshine, forever bright
You filled my dark world with the most beautiful light

And once again I say, even if you don’t believe it’s true
My heart is full of love and happiness because of you
I’ll work hard to put a smile on your face through all our days
Because I will love you now, forever, and always
        </p>

          <h2>She Is My Light</h2>
          <button class="audio-btn" data-audio="assets/audio/poem2.m4a">
            ▶ Listen
          </button>
        </div>

        <p>
To the one who I call my light
The one who helped me see when there was only darkness in sight
You don’t know how grateful I am to you
Because of you I know love and happiness are true

My life was hard and filled with pain
For years I asked why and searched for someone to blame
But then God gave me someone
Who shined brighter than the sun

Someone with the most beautiful smile
With the power to lift me up and ease my pain for a while
Eyes more dazzling than any gem
That take my breath whenever I’m near them

Some may say she is only a girl
But to me she is my entire world
I joke that she’s the thief who stole my heart
But truly she’s the one who kept me from falling apart

You don’t know how much you saved me
Every day you help put the pieces back together of who I used to be
Every glance I take steals my breath away
Your beauty still amazes me every day

Though I may seem confident, at heart I’m just a fool
Please let me serve you, let me be your tool
From the moment I met you I knew it was right
I finally found the one I call my light
